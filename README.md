# `rsmt2`

A generic library to interact with SMT-LIB 2 compliant solvers running in a separate system process,
such as [Z3][z3] and [CVC4][cvc4].


If you use this library consider contacting us on the [repository](https://github.com/kino-mc/rsmt2)
so that we can add your project to the readme.

See [`changes.md`](https://github.com/kino-mc/rsmt2/blob/master/README.md) for the list of changes.
